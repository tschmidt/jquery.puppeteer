        <h3>What Is This?</h3>
				<p>
					Have you seen one of those sites where when you are scrolling down the page
					things all of a sudden start happening? Have you wondered how they did it? Or 
					wished you could have a simple way to add that to your site?
				</p>
				<p>
					That is exactly what this plugin is intended to help you with.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Some Background</h3>
				<p>
					When I set out to create this plugin, I was actually hoping someone else had
					already done it. Unfortunately, all I could find were articles with half-baked
					examples or snippets of code. No full blown plugin that would handle everything
					I needed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So, I did what any good web dev does. I built my own tool.
				</p>
				
				<h3>My Approach</h3>
				<p>
					I knew I wanted this to be as simple as possible. I also knew that I didn't want
					the Javascript controlling anything but the class assignments. The way I see it,
					most modern browsers do a pretty good job of supporting CSS3 and CSS animations.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Because of that, all of the logic for the animations is actually contained in the
					stylesheets. Now, there is an age-old debate on whether this is the proper place
					for it but I have clearly chosen a side, so don't bother spamming me in an
					attempt to sway my decision on this matter.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This libraries sole responsibility is to watch the DOM elements as you scroll
					and to determine whether the CSS classes you have defined should be applied or
					not. Okay, it's a little more complicated than that, but this stripped down
					explanation will work for now.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>
					Most of the "how to" is already covered on the github project. Please view the
					<a href='https://github.com/tschmidt/jquery.puppeteer/blob/master/README.md'>README</a> for further details.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I will also be adding examples to this project to make it super simple for you
					to get in and see live demos.

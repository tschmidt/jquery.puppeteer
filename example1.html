			<h1>jQuery Puppeteer : Example One</h1>
			<p>
				This is a very simple example of using the $.fn.puppeteer plugin. This example
				was blatantly ripped off from this <a href='http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/07/18/on-scroll-effect-layout/'>Codrops Blueprint article</a> which was also
				partly responsible for this plugins creation.
